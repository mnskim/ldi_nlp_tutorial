# Introduction to Natural Language Processing in Python

Please visit [Language and Data Intelligence Lab](https://seungwonh.github.io/ldi.html) for more information.

This tutorial is largely based on fastai's excellent [NLP Lecture Series](https://github.com/fastai/course-nlp). The course is taught in Python with Google Colab Notebooks, using libraries such as sklearn, nltk, pytorch, and fastai.
